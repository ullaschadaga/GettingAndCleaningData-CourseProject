Getting And Cleaning Data - Course Project
==========================================

This is the repository for "Getting And Cleaning Data" Course Project on Coursera

This README file includes information on what is needed to run the script.

This has been tested on a Mac machine with OS X 10.9.3 and R version 3.1.0 (2014-04-10).

Raw data needed by this script can be found here -

Copy the script run_analysis.R into a folder.
Extract the zip file given above in the same folder. You should see a folder "UCI HAR Dataset" there with the raw data in it.

Source the file run_analysis.R into R.

Execute - run_analysis()

It will produce the output file (i.e., the tidy data set) - Avg_Each_Variable_ForEach_Activity_And_Subject.csv in the same folder.
